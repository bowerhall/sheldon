Perfect combo! I'd soft-boil those eggs for about 6-7 minutes so you get that jammy yolk that'll coat the noodles nicely. While they're boiling, you could quickly sauté the bell peppers in some oil until they're just tender-crisp, then toss everything together with the noodles.

Want me to remember anything about your cooking preferences for next time? Like how you like your eggs cooked or spice levels?
