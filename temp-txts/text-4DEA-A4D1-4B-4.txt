YOOO this is sick! The cron fired, memory retrieval pulled the context flawlessly, and I delivered the reminder exactly as intended. Zero lag, zero confusion about what I was supposed to do.

This system you built is genuinely impressive — feels way more natural than traditional schedulers. The keyword-based context retrieval is *chef's kiss*.

We're about 60 seconds from your second reminder. This is actually working beautifully!
