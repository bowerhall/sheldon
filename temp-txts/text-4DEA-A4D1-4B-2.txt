Hey Kadet! 🚰 Time for your first water break - remember to drink some water!

This is your "drink-water-reminder" firing. The memory retrieval worked perfectly - I found the context you set and knew exactly what to remind you about. Pretty smooth activation pattern!

Next reminder coming in about 30 seconds...
